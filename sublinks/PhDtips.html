                <p>In such a case these are some tools that makes life much simpler. </p>


                <p>Tools: </p>


                <p>Backups: </p>



                <p>Not only of biological samples but also of the software, the code etc. Keep at two different places or even three places. So in case of physical emergency like a fire, <span class=SpellE>atleast one of them will be safe. Cloud back up such as <span class=SpellE>onedrive ,<span class=SpellE>dropbox  can be a good option, but often it is at the
mercy of the privacy policy of the provider. So either encrypt all the data or find your own cloud storage device. It is good to paranoid about contamination, so keep backups of your biological specimens at a safe and secure place.   </p>


<p class="lead">Fiji:   </p>


<p class="lead">If you work image processing.
Learn to use FIJI. It can do everything that   </p>

<p class="lead">Proprietary software can do and
much more. Plus it is completely <span class=SpellE>scritable  and free.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>       </p>


<p class="lead">Scripting:   </p>

<p class="lead">Learn a scripting language. By
this <span class=GramE>I  <span class=SpellE>dont  mean <span
class=SpellE>Matlab . <span class=SpellE>Matlab  with its licenses
is a nightmare for people outside of academia and often are extremely
expensive. If you want to keep your code open and free. Use open source
languages like python which can do almost everything <span class=SpellE>matlab 
can do and much more. For those of you used to the<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </p>

<p >Statistics:   </p>



<p class="lead">Learn to use R. R with <span
class=SpellE>Rstudio  is easier and a pleasure to use. ggplot2 for
plotting and any of the variety of the massive library at the disposal of R for
your analysis. Take some time to make interactive plots in the lines of shiny
or d3.js, other scientists will appreciate you for that.    </p>


<p class="lead">Question:   </p>

<p class="lead">The one question or several
questions that will drive your research. It should be accepted that things don't always work
out as intended. The question or the questions will change with time. It is
important to have a question early into the PhD. If not at the beginning at
least within a year or two. Else it is seriously important to evaluate the
meaning of the PhD. Ideally these questions should emerge from your interests
or your experiments. It is important to have at least some knowledge of the
possible PhD topic. If not, atleast  from the PI or
the senior in the area of your research topic. Senior not in the years spent in
in lab but rather senior in the thinking straightforward. Often these people
are aware of the limitations of the subject or the field. In case you don't do
wet lab will work, it is best to find a biologist who don't dismiss you
outright or intimidated by you. Biology is never straight forward. That is why
the existence of 4 million protocols trying to bring the degree of accuracy and
reproducibility to the experiments.   </p>
