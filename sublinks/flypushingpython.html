                <p class="lead"> A stock is group of flies. To get a desired genotype, one has to cross flies with a set of rules. I wrote a python script in my spare time to replicate the elements of a cross to generate a stable stock (preserving the genotype of the fly). Writing this script helped me understand the complexity behind a simplest cross. It is possible that fundamentals of genetics can be easier to learn with programming logic. &nbsp;

        <p class="lead">Drosophila is a cool model organisms that is studied in developmental biology. Fly genetics is extremely advanced with a history of hundred years,(<a li="http://www.columbia.edu/cu/alumni/Magazine/Legacies/Morgan/">Thomas Hunt morgan</a>.) The two major tasks for any fly pusher (handler of the flies) are taking care of the stocks and learning to make crosses as well a complex array of other tasks which i wont go into detail. Both of these are extremely time-consuming and also error prone.

                <p class="lead">Background:

                <p class="lead">Drosophila have 4 chromosomes. They are known in the order X/Y ; 2R/2L; 3R/3L; 4 for a male and X/X ; 2R/2L; 3R/3L; 4 for a female. Since 4th chromosome is too small, it is usually not targeted. The majority of the genetics done are targeting the first 3 chromosomes. The elegant simplicity of using Drosophila for genetics comes with chromosomes called balancers. These are chromosomes that underwent mutagenesis so much that they donâ€™t recombine anymore (There is still <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>a
                    extremely tiny likelihood that this might happen though).There are several standard balancers available for a typical fly pusher for all the chromosomes. The existence of this chromosome in the fly sometimes comes with a marker in the adult, larvae or pupae fly. This makes easier to select for individuals that are the correct genotype. Balancer chromosomes have many mutations that make the chromosome almost entirely nonfunctional. Having a balancer in the system allows us to only think of one chromosome at a time and not worry about recombining with the other one.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
In the condition when two balancers come together on the same chromosome, the individual usually dies in the embryonic stage. The tradeoff is the health of the flies as they tend to be much weaker with more number of balancers than a wild type fly.
                    <o:p></o:p>
                    
                </p>

                <p class="lead">Example: <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>CyO is one such type of balancer on the second chromosome. It has a dominant marker that causes the adult wings to curl upwards depending upon the temperature. For an excellent reference, check <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/book/9780123846884">Atlas of drosophila morphology.</a>

                </p>


                <p class="lead">Balancers are predominantly of two types. One is a weak balancer effect. Second is a strong balancer. The weak one is used typically used for its marker properties. Since it can just be a normal/partially functional chromosome or not so much mutated chromosome with a marker, the likelihood of recombination in case of pairing with a normal chromosome is much higher. Stronger balancers will preserve whatever is on the other chromosome and can usually considered as the gold standard for balancing.

                <p class="lead">It is still possible to use a non-stable stock for your experiments. Just discard them after you finish doing the experiment. It is not wise to propagate such stocks as due to the threat of recombination. This means it is not always easy to say what is the genotype of the next generation? This can considered to be an unclean way of doing a cross. Recombination does not happen in males, so it is possible to imagine a scenario where you can use the males to pass the genes to a next generation without recombination. But that will of course will use too much energy.

The software should be able to search for the transgenes, the balancers and give you a best possible parents to choose from. This is not implemented as of now.
