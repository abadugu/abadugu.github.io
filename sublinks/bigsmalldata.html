                <p>&nbsp;
                    
                    
                </p>

                <p class="lead">The hype of big data in biology remains the same as it was few years ago. But the difference is that we have much more experience and better educated about it. We can now carefully think of what it brought to the table for those projects. First, big data can only follow reliable studies done on small data and then confirm them on a much larger scale. So in the purest sense, it can be used to validate something that is carefully tested. Second, If the reasoning and the models are wrong at the smallest level, then no amount of data would help except obfuscate our understanding more. </p>
                    
                   <p class="lead"> It is much easier to apply big data analysis in an engineering environment as the principles are often extremely reliable and the result of solid research for several decades. Even there it can often be bad. It is difficult to apply an big data approach in a biology environment. For some projects, it can be considered as wishful thinking at this moment in time. Biology is much more prone to noise and lacks the same set of unifying principles that sets engineering apart. </p>
                                  
            <p class="lead"> Some big data projects that provide access to scientific information really work. Examples of such projects include <span class=SpellE>pubmed, <span class=SpellE>google scholar <span class=SpellE>etc. Sometimes too much information can also be a bad thing as it distracts, confuses especially with conflicting data. </p>
                
                   <p class="lead">    After half a century of studies in genetics, one of the first major big data study came with the human genome project. Though it helped bridge a lot of gaps of what exists in the genome.  What did it actually deliver to the pool of questions available to be tested? If at all, it made things more confusing by increasing the bar for many biologsts. Our understanding of the mechanisms did not appear overnight when the data became available. Instead it came slowly with a lot of small experiments by many dedicated groups around the world. Only time can give conclusive evidence whether investing all this resources in this one large project is a good idea. There are many projects which follow similar lines of this project and lacks clear defined questions. A friend once said &quot;There seems to be a general level of underlying cluelessness about questions in large-scale omics, computational and imaging projects&quot;. Just because we are looking at tera/petabytes of data, the questions don't magically appear.

                <p class="lead">There are usually no artifacts at this level if the systematic error is accounted for, just models for edge effects which now with the larger data will become clearer. This is according to somebody who studies edge effects in big data sets.

                <p class="lead">If underlying model is bad, then no amount of data can save it. It is the same logic one can apply to modeling projects, if the experimental data is bad, then no amount of modeling can correct that.

                <p class="lead">In summary we need to have careful approaches of estimating/understanding what makes sense to study at a big data level and what does not. In biology, smaller studies are always required and often tell us more about a system. It is fine if every project cannot be expanded to dealing with big data. If we donâ€™t understand what happens at the smaller scale, increasing the complexity will only increase the confusion and delivering very little. If you do have something which works at a smaller level, ask the following: Would anyone be studying the same data in 30 years from now? Will it matter at that time?
