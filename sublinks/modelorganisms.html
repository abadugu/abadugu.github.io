                <p class="lead">I spent the last couple of years working with one species of fruit flies <i> Drosophila melanogaster</i>. <i>Drosophila</i> is an amazing animal with complexity which we have not even began to understand. A few points of why I love working with it in the context of tissue mechanics and genetics.
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;
                </p>

                <p class="lead">Drosophila
                    </i> genetics is often called as the swiss army knife in the genetics field. Techniques such as like UAS-GAL4, GAL4-GAL80[TS], FLP-FRT are elegant.
                </p>
                <p class="lead"> A model studied in <i>Drosophila</i> may contain less number of components but still hold the essence of development. In simple terms, the principles have emerged at an ancient time point and are evolutionarily conserved among most invertebrates and vertebrates. Less complexity is always a good thing for doing research though <a href="./bigsmalldata.html">big data</a> hype goes the other way.  
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                   Many studies have been done at the single cell level to understand the mechanics in cell lines. Taking them to a tissue level adds a whole new set of problems. Working on <i>Drosophila</i> can help us bridge the gaps. It offers one of the best systems to do tissue level mechanics and therefore one of the best systems to unify the fields of genetics and mechanics in a concrete way. From what I observed so far, such principles can easily translate to vertebrate systems. </p>
                <p class="lead">      
                   Single cell level manipulations can be easily transalated into <i>Drosophila</i> provided experiments have sufficient background thinking and supported by good models. Similar manipulations cannot be done in mammalian systems. A good example is the issue of depth of penetration into the tissue with the microscope of interest. Mammalian tissues are often too thick to look through and therefore should be sectioned which brings a whole other problem of being time-consuming and need a good set of trained hands.
                </p>

                <p class="lead"> 
                   Speed of the research. Often it is just so much faster than working with say <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_mouse"><i>Mus
musculus</i></a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_rat"><i>Rattus
norvegicus</i></a>. This allows the experimentalist to plan and do a quick and dirty experiment to see how true the particular phenomenon is. After doing<i>
in-silico</i> modelling for a few years, this is the closest I have ever seen a parameter sweep done in real living system.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                   Reproducibility of the research by taking larger sample sizes. Large sample sizes means it is less prone to studying artifacts. I know somebody in the lab who have used up to N=40,000 to make a point even though N=30-few hundreds is much more common in most publications.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                   Cost of research is lower than higher order model systems and some organoid systems. The example of the <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cu/alumni/Magazine/Legacies/Morgan/">FLY Room</a> at Columbia serves as a classical example of great science done in cheap surroundings.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">Then again if your methodology and interpretations are bad, nothing can save you even the experimental system. Sadly the amount of money being allocated to this field of research has steadily going down in the last few years. The critics of the research argue that it is often not &quot;translational&quot;. Somehow it is preferable to do really expensive research probing in the dark when working with cell lines and mammalian models which are often not translational or reproducible.
